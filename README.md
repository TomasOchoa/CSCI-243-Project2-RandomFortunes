## Program 2: Random Fortunes
## Description:
* Write a program using the fortune program and curses to generate a random cursor position in a terminal window, and display a fortune starting at that position. 
* After five seconds, your program should clear the terminal window, generate a new random position, and display a new fortune starting at that position. 
* See chapter 7 of the text for hints as to how to do this.
